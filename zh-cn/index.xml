Each one of the wallet’s private keys is a randomised 256-bit number unique to your wallet, and it is what you need to be able to access and spend your coins. Your public address - the address which other Dogecoin wallets can use to send Dogecoin to your wallet - is a hashed version of the public key associated with the private key.</description></item><item><title>A whale holds nearly 30% of Dogecoin supply! Is this true?</title><link>/zh-cn/dogepedia/faq/dogecoin-whale-wallets/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Apr 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/zh-cn/dogepedia/faq/dogecoin-whale-wallets/</guid><description>A common source of FUD surrounding Dogecoin is the claim that certain wallets holding a large percentage of the supply are owned by private investors or so-called &amp;ldquo;whales&amp;rdquo;. In reality, many of the top Dogecoin wallets are cold wallets or hot wallets controlled by exchanges and brokers, and they thus represent Dogecoin held in custody for thousands - or hundreds of thousands, even - of people.
To those accustomed to blockchain analysis, many of those wallets appear as wallets managed by trading platforms, as they exhibit patterns of activity and volume that were typical of crypto exchanges or brokerage services holding large amounts of collateral.</description></item><item><title>How can I become a Dogecoin developer?</title><link>/zh-cn/dogepedia/articles/becoming-a-dogecoin-developer/</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 Apr 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/zh-cn/dogepedia/articles/becoming-a-dogecoin-developer/</guid><description>Dogecoin is an open-source project, meaning that anyone with some technical know-how can contribute to Dogecoin’s technical development. Even if you’re new to the space, it’s never too late to learn new tricks!
Dogecoin has an amazing team of developers and volunteers who are committed to welcoming new people into the space and helping them to learn and develop their skills. The community is extremely encouraging, too, and it’s very common to see old Shibes helping new Shibes as they enter the space.</description></item><item><title>狗狗币毫无用处!</title><link>/zh-cn/dogepedia/faq/dogecoin-has-no-utility/</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 Apr 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/zh-cn/dogepedia/faq/dogecoin-has-no-utility/</guid><description>不，狗狗币有用，而且它一直很有用！一个简单的事实是，钱是有用的，而狗狗币就是钱! 而且，狗狗币是少见的为成为货币这一目标而生的加密货币。
狗狗币起初因玩笑而生，他过去很好的遵循了这个传统，未来也将保持这个传统。狗狗币自诞生之日起，就被作为小费用于激励人们做一些有意义的事情：赞助牙买加雪橇队参加冬奥会、建造肯尼亚水井、建造狗狗币汽车以及许多狗狗币社区支持的疯狂创意。作为一种打赏货币，狗狗币始终保持了它诞生之初的用途，相较于同期的其他货币，狗狗币区块链上的交易费率低廉，交易速度更快。
经过多年发展，使用狗狗币在网上商店进行消费已经成为可能。过去两年，随着狗狗币支付集成到第三方支付比如BitPay、Coinbase及一些支持狗狗币的预付卡提供商，狗狗币的使用呈爆发态势。商店还可以通过JSON-RPC接口直接集成到狗狗币区块链上。狗狗币基金会正在同开发者一起，计划通过创建一些标准化、流程化的软件包，来使得狗狗币支付更便捷。
我们正在进行开发，以增强狗狗币相较其他加密货币在实用性上的优势。随着好几个团队持续建设狗狗币及其生态，狗狗币还将找到新的实用场景。
根据狗狗币宣言，狗狗币秉承实用原则、友好原则、开放原则以及稳健原则，同时要保持独特的快乐文化。</description></item><item><title>What is a mining pool?</title><link>/zh-cn/dogepedia/articles/what-is-a-mining-pool/</link><pubDate>Sat, 16 Apr 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/zh-cn/dogepedia/articles/what-is-a-mining-pool/</guid><description>Mining pools are services, operated by third parties not affiliated with Dogecoin, which allow a group of miners to combine their hashing power when attempting to solve the &amp;ldquo;puzzles&amp;rdquo; involved in mining Dogecoin.
Mining rewards - consisting of 10,000 Dogecoin per block plus transaction fees associated to the transactions included in the block - are awarded to the miner who discovers a valid Proof of Work for a new block before any other miner in the network.</description></item><item><title>狗狗币如何运转?</title><link>/zh-cn/dogepedia/articles/how-does-dogecoin-work/</link><pubDate>Sat, 16 Apr 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/zh-cn/dogepedia/articles/how-does-dogecoin-work/</guid><description>魔法和模因文化！（开玩笑的啦~）
重中之重: 狗狗币是货币。
和其他流行的加密货币一样, 狗狗币通过区块链技术运转。但是，和其他绝大多数加密货币不同，狗狗币的交易费用非常低，交易确认的速度又非常快。
首先，如果你想向世界上任何地方的某个人寄一笔钱或者收一笔钱，但是你又不想使用中心化的银行从而需要支付外币兑换和转账费用，那么狗狗币就是你的好选择！
除此之外，狗狗币还可以用来购买商品和服务，可以在Reddit和Twitter这样的社交平台上打赏小费，更多关于狗狗币用途和运转方式的信息，请参阅社区和生态!

Each of these nodes is running specialized software. Dogecoin Core, Dogecoin&amp;rsquo;s reference implementation, is the software more commonly used to run a Dogecoin node. It can be downloaded from the official Dogecoin.com website and directly from the Github repository.
Running a full node is a service that volunteers in the network, called node operators, provide to the Dogecoin community.</description></item><item><title>Can you put a cap on Dogecoin?</title><link>/zh-cn/dogepedia/faq/putting-a-cap-on-dogecoin/</link><pubDate>Fri, 22 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/zh-cn/dogepedia/faq/putting-a-cap-on-dogecoin/</guid><description>Right now, and for the next hundred years or so, Dogecoin operates like, and will continue to operate like, most other crypto assets. “Capped” assets are nowhere near mined out – and will continue adding to their supply, just like Dogecoin, for the foreseeable future.
Dogecoin’s supply is not unlimited, because it has an absolute limit of issuance per block, per day, per year – just like other coins do. The only difference is that Dogecoin’s issuance does not have an end date.</description></item><item><title>Charities Accepting Doge</title><link>/zh-cn/dogepedia/articles/charities-accepting-doge/</link><pubDate>Fri, 22 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/zh-cn/dogepedia/articles/charities-accepting-doge/</guid><description>Dogecoin’s history includes many charitable endeavours: from funding clean water wells in 2014 for Kenya, to the #TeamSeas initiative in 2021 – and many worthwhile causes in-between. The past year, though, has seen a dramatic increase in charities directly accepting Dogecoin donations – which is very much wow!
Organisations like The Giving Block make it super easy for charities to accept Dogecoin and other cryptocurrency donations. Initiatives like The Water Project — which has been accepting Dogecoin for over 6-years — now use The Giving Block to accept Dogecoin donations to fund fully monitored water projects in Africa.</description></item><item><title>Dogecoin and Privacy</title><link>/zh-cn/dogepedia/articles/dogecoin-and-privacy/</link><pubDate>Fri, 22 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/zh-cn/dogepedia/articles/dogecoin-and-privacy/</guid><description>Privacy is an interesting topic, and one in which Dogecoin community members are actively involved. For starters, it’s worthwhile acknowledging that every transaction on the blockchain is public. That is, it’s possible for anyone to see any Dogecoin transaction that has ever been made if you have the public wallet address! This is why, if you wish to remain anonymous, it’s important not to claim any public address as yours.</description></item></channel></rss>
